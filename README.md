Usage
-------------

Our usage model:

* separate service uses [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) + this plugin
* web uses [Paper Trail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail) + [Rails Admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin).

Be sure that you have a proper tables from [Paper Trail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail) v0.6.x.

Than you can subscribe a model on create, update, destroy callbacks.

Quick start:

```ruby

require 'sequel_paper_trail'
require 'sequel'
require 'sequel/plugins/has_paper_trail'

Album.pligin :has_paper_trail,
             class_name: 'VersionClassName'
# or

Album.pligin :has_paper_trail,
             item_class_name: SomeAlbum,
             class_name: 'VersionClassName'

```

Enable versioning globaly:

```ruby

SequelPaperTrail.enabled = true

```

Enable versioning for block of code:

```ruby

SequelPaperTrail.with_versioning { 'code' }

```

Disable versioning globaly:

```ruby

SequelPaperTrail.enabled = false

```

Disable versioning for block of code

```ruby

SequelPaperTrail.with_versioning(false) { 'code' }

```

Set whodunnit:

```ruby

SequelPaperTrail.whodunnit = 'Mr. Smith'

# or if you are using a web server and want thread safety

SequelPaperTrail.whodunnit = -> { req.env["USER_ID"] }

```

Set info_for_paper_trail - additional info (Hash) which will be attached to versions table.

```ruby

# If you have 'release' and 'instance' columns in a versions table you can populate them.

SequelPaperTrail.info_for_paper_trail = { release: 'asdf131234', instance: `hostname` }

# or if you are using a web server and want thread safety

SequelPaperTrail.info_for_paper_trail = -> { release: current_release }

```

Note that if you use a lambda for whodunnit or info_for_paper_trail, you may run into errors with binding.  To fix that, you can do something like this:

```

```ruby

this = self
SequelPaperTrail.whodunnit = -> { this.current_user_id }

```


Development
--------------

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
